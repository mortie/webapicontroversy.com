This can be for a wide range of reasons and the intention of this page is not to pick sides and frame an API as either good or bad. The purpose of this site is purely to collect references to each browser vendors own public signals, to help the community better get a vendor independent overview of the status of these API:s. Also highlighted is their respective status on the W3C standards track."

Rather than just collect those references for myself, I gathered them on this page. I will happily list additional API:s that people have observed a controversy in."
